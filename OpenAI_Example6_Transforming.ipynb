My daughter absolutely adores this plush toy and takes it everywhere with her. The material is incredibly soft and the design is undeniably cute. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems to be a manufacturing flaw rather than intentional asymmetry.\n\nWhile I am pleased with the quality and overall design of the plush toy, I must admit that I found it to be a bit smaller than expected given the price point. I believe there may be larger options available for the same price. Despite this minor setback, I was pleasantly surprised when the item arrived a day earlier than anticipated. This allowed me to enjoy playing with the plush toy myself before presenting it to my daughter.\n\nIn conclusion, while I have some reservations about the size and minor design flaw, I am overall satisfied with the purchase. The early delivery was a pleasant surprise and the softness and cuteness of the plush toy make it a worthwhile addition to my daughter's collection. I would recommend exploring other size options before making a final decision, but I can confidently say that this panda plush toy has brought joy to both my daughter and myself."
